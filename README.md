# Magic-Square-
A square filled with numbers so that the total of each row, each column and each main diagonal are all the same.
In example of matrix 3x3, each row, column and main diagonal add up to 15.
The squares can be 3Ã—3, 5x5 and larger(should be odd starting from 3x3).
This Program can only solve odd magic squares.
